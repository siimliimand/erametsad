# Ops Evidence

Write a capture plan so the Visual Evidence CI workflow can capture screenshots on a runner with full Docker and Chrome access.

The agent runs inside the awf sandbox where Docker-in-Docker is unsupported and headless Chromium's sandbox is blocked by the container security policy. The agent cannot capture screenshots itself. Instead, it analyzes the diff and writes a `capturePlan` in `evidence.json`. A separate CI workflow executes the plan.

## Convention

Every platform project has `pnpm run dev` at root that starts the **full stack** (database + API + web). The app runs with mock auth in development mode (no real authentication needed). This is the only contract — no per-project evidence harness, fixture apps, or scenario registries.

## Input

The caller provides (all optional):
- change id: locates `openspec/changes/{change-id}/` (or the archived `archive/*{change-id}/`).
- issue / work-item ref and PR number: where to publish.
- output mode (`default` / `push` / `pr`): whether the branch was pushed.
- operation: `capture` (default), `publish`, or `both`.

## Part 1: Capture (operation: capture / both)

**Step 1: Decide whether evidence is required.** Inspect the change's diff:
- Required when changed files include user-visible UI: `*.tsx/jsx/vue/svelte`, `*.css/scss/less`, pages, layouts, components, navigation.
- Skipped when docs-only, internal refactor, dependency-only, test-only, backend-only.
- Mixed or unknown: required (be safe).

If skipped: write `evidence.json` with `status: "skipped"` and reason. Done.

**Step 2: Discover routes from git diff.** Parse changed files to determine which routes to screenshot:
- `pages/**/*.tsx` or `app/**/page.tsx` → extract the route path
- `features/**/*.tsx` or `components/**/*.tsx` → screenshot the homepage and any routes that import the changed component
- If no routes found → screenshot `/` only
- Always include `/` (homepage) as a baseline

**Step 3: Write `evidence.json` with `capturePlan`.** The agent never attempts to start the app stack or launch a browser — those always fail inside the awf sandbox. Instead, write a `capturePlan` immediately.

### The `capturePlan` schema

```
capturePlan:
  routes:           # Array of route objects to screenshot (at minimum [{ path: "/" }])
    - path: string  # URL path, e.g. "/quotes/:id"
      sampleId:     # string | "first" | "any" — how to resolve dynamic segments
      caption:      # string — human-readable description of what this screenshot shows
  viewports:        # Array of viewport objects
    - width: number
      height: number
      label: string # "desktop" | "mobile" | custom
  requireApi:       # boolean — true when the route needs the backend API running
  requireLogin:     # boolean — true when the route needs authentication
  loginMethod:      # string — "mock-sso" | "none" | custom method identifier
  reason:           # string — why evidence was blocked and what the screenshots should show
```

### Rules for writing capturePlan

1. `routes` MUST always include `{ path: "/", caption: "Homepage" }` as the first entry.
2. Every additional route discovered from the diff goes after the homepage entry.
3. `sampleId: "first"` means the CI workflow should use the first record returned by the API (e.g. the first quote from the seed data). `sampleId: "any"` means any valid ID.
4. `requireApi` is `true` when any route needs the backend to return data. It is `false` only for purely static pages (login, not-found).
5. `requireLogin` is `true` when any route needs authentication. For dev mode with mock auth, `loginMethod` is `"mock-sso"`.
6. `reason` should explain both WHY capture was blocked and WHAT the screenshots should show once captured.

### Example `evidence.json`

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "changeId": "currency-in-project-details",
  "required": true,
  "status": "blocked",
  "assets": [],
  "capturePlan": {
    "routes": [
      { "path": "/", "sampleId": "any", "caption": "Homepage / accounts list" },
      { "path": "/quotes/:id", "sampleId": "first", "caption": "Quote editor with currency selector in ProjectDetailsCard" }
    ],
    "viewports": [
      { "width": 1280, "height": 720, "label": "desktop" },
      { "width": 375, "height": 667, "label": "mobile" }
    ],
    "requireApi": true,
    "requireLogin": true,
    "loginMethod": "mock-sso",
    "reason": "Currency selector moved from editor body into ProjectDetailsCard; visual change in quote editor page."
  },
  "reason": "Visual evidence cannot be captured inside the awf sandbox (Docker-in-Docker unsupported, headless Chromium sandbox blocked). A capturePlan has been written for the Visual Evidence CI workflow.",
  "prMarkdown": "## Evidence\n\nVisual evidence for this change is **blocked** in this agent run. A `capturePlan` has been written to `evidence.json` — the Visual Evidence CI workflow will execute it on a runner with full Docker and Chrome access.\n\nAutomated verification that did run:\n- Lint: clean\n- Tests: all pass\n- Build: success"
}
```

### When evidence is not required

If evidence is skipped (no UI files changed), write without a `capturePlan`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "changeId": "{change-id}",
  "required": false,
  "status": "skipped",
  "assets": [],
  "reason": "No user-visible UI files changed in this PR.",
  "prMarkdown": "## Evidence\n\nSkipped: no user-visible UI changes."
}
```

Capture never commits, stages, or pushes. The caller owns git.

## Part 2: Publish (operation: publish / both)

Preconditions:
- An issue/PR number was provided. Else skip.
- Image URLs resolve only if the branch was pushed (`pr`/`push` modes).
- Backlog platform from `.opencode/harness.json`; `none` means skip.

<!-- PC-PLATFORM-EVIDENCE-START -->
**ALL GitHub data MUST come from `gh` CLI. NEVER use webfetch, HTTP requests, or browser MCP tools for GitHub. If `gh` is unavailable, skip publishing (report it) — do not fail the pipeline over it unless the caller declared publishing a ship gate.**
Always pass `--repo {owner}/{repo}` (or `repos/{owner}/{repo}` for `gh api`) explicitly.

Publish one status comment for every manifest. A `blocked` or `failed` manifest must include its status and reason, never a success claim.

### Step 1 — Build commit-pinned repository links

An embedded image must be a raw URL pinned to the commit that actually contains it, and that commit must be pushed. For each asset in `evidence.json`:

```bash
SHA="$(git log -n 1 --format=%H -- '{asset-path}')"          # the commit that added this asset
[ -z "$SHA" ] && echo "asset not committed: {asset-path}" && exit-skip
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{asset-path}?ref=$SHA" --silent   # 404 → not pushed yet → skip embedding
```

Build a blob link for every committed manifest and asset: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{SHA}/{asset-path}`. Use the raw URL only for a verified embeddable image: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{SHA}/{asset-path}`. If verification fails, include the asset path and SHA as text; never post a dead link.

### Step 2 — Build the comment body with a stable marker (idempotent)

Prefix the body with a hidden marker so re-runs update the same comment instead of piling on:

```
<!-- pc-visual-evidence:{change-id} -->

Status: `{status}`

{reason?}

Manifest: {commit-pinned evidence.json link}

Assets: {commit-pinned asset links}

{prMarkdown}
```

### Step 3 — Upsert the comment on BOTH the issue and the PR

For each target number (the originating issue, and the PR number when provided), find an existing marked comment and PATCH it, else POST a new one:

```bash
# find existing
ID="$(gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments" --paginate --jq \
  '.[] | select(.body | contains("<!-- pc-visual-evidence:{change-id} -->")) | .id' | head -1)"

if [ -n "$ID" ]; then
  gh api --method PATCH "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/$ID" -f body="$BODY" --silent
else
  gh api --method POST  "repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments" -f body="$BODY" --silent
fi
```

- Text-only (no verified image, or `default` mode / nothing pushed): drop the image lines, keep the summary (tasks N/N, verification result, commits).
- If a comment call fails: report it. Fail the run ONLY when the caller declared publishing a ship gate; otherwise continue.
<!-- PC-PLATFORM-EVIDENCE-END -->

## Report

One block: the `status` (passed/skipped/failed/blocked) and why; capturePlan written or why not. Never present a blocked capture as passed.
